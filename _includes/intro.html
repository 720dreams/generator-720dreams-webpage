    <p>Web app generator is a <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman generator</a> for building front-end web apps. It automates common tasks such as JavaScript linting, assets compression, compiling Sass with Autoprefixer etc. so you can get that out of the way and focus on more important stuff. This generator is powered by Gulp, if Grunt is more your cup of tea, check out <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp">generator-webapp</a>.</p>
